		<h1>PATH PARADOX</h1>
		<h2>Forging your own path has its consequences...</h2> 
		<p>Path Paradox is an online multi-player game based on the popular board game <em>Tsuro</em>. Place a tile in front of your token to continue your path, but be careful to keep your token on the board as the last one remaining wins.</p>

		<h3>Getting Started</h3>
		<p>Begin by logging in with your Google account—we only use your account to track you as a unique player and display your name, you will not be spammed!</p>

		<p>You are welcome to create a new game room and invite your friends, or wait for other players to join. You may also join a game room that someone else created. A game can be played with up to 8 players.</p>

		<p>Once you have entered a game room you will be prompted to select a color and then to select a starting point along the edge of the board.</p>

		<h3>Tiles</h3>
		<p>Once you've selected a starting point you will be dealt three tiles to your 'hand' along the left edge of the board. Each tile has a unique combination of four paths. Your first tile is placed onto the board into your next playable space. Click on another tile to try it out, or click the clockwise and counter-clockwise buttons on the sides of the tiles to rotate them in any direction. </p>

		<h3>Turns</h3>
		<p>The turn order is determined by the order in which players joined the game and is listed along the right side of the board. The current player's name is larger in the list. If it is your turn your name will be bouncing and you will have the option of placing your tile</p>

<p>Paths on a tile might cross one another, but they are proceed uninterrupted and independently of the others.</p>

<h2>Playing the game:</h2>
<p>Each player will be dealt 3 tiles. Once placed a tile, draw one from the deck. Follow the path that’s in front of your marker till the end of the path. If a player is lead to the edge of the board, this player cannot keep playing anymore, and should return all the tiles to the deck. Shuffle the deck. If a player needs a tile but there’s no tile in the deck, this player will be put in a waiting queue with all other players who need tile as well. Once there are tiles in the deck, all the players in the waiting queue will be given one tile at a time until each player has three tiles in hand, or the deck is out of tile again. This action repeats till the end of the game. If the all 35 tiles are placed on the game board and at least one player is on the game board, all the players that are still on the game board won. If there’s only one player on the game board, this player won. If two players bump into each other on the same path, they both are disqualified to play for the next round.
If there’s no one left on the game board, no one won.</p>
