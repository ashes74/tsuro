		<h1>PATH PARADOX</h1>
		<h2>Forging your own path has its consequences...</h2> 
		<p>Path Paradox is an online multi-player game based on the popular board game <em>Tsuro</em>. Place a tile in front of your token to continue your path, but be careful to keep your token on the board, and don't run into other players, as the last one remaining wins.</p>

		<h3>Getting Started</h3>
		<p>Begin by logging in with your Google accountâ€”we only use your account to track you as a unique player and to display your name, you will not be spammed!</p>

		<p>You are welcome to create a new game room and invite your friends, or wait for other players to join. You may also join a game room that someone else created. A game can be played with up to 8 players.</p>

		<p>Once you have entered a game room you will be prompted to select a color and then to select a starting point along the edge of the board.</p>

		<h3>Tiles</h3>
		<p>Once you've selected a starting point you will be dealt three tiles to your 'hand', located along the left edge of the board. Each tile has a unique combination of four paths. Your first tile is pre-placed onto the board into your next playable space. Click on another tile to try it out, or click the clockwise and counter-clockwise buttons on the sides of the tiles to rotate them in any direction.</p>

		<h3>Taking your Turn</h3>
		<p>When it is your turn your name will be bouncing in the player list on the right side of the board and you will have the option of placing your chosen tile. Be careful when placing your tile! Your token will automatically move to the end of any natural path in front of it. If a player's token moves to the edge of the board, that player has lost. If two players collide on the same path, both players will lose.</p>

		<p>Tiles in a losing player's hands are shuffled back into the deck. Players with less than 3 cards in their hand will be dealt additional cards if an empty deck receives additional cards.</p>

		<h3>Winning</h3>
		<p>The winner is the last player remaining on the board, or multiple players left on the board once all tiles have been played. It is possible to play a game with no winners, or all winners!</p>
